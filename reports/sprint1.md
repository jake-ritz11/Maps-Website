## Policies

* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code

### Test Driven Development

### Processes
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics


* The goal of the Team Identification epic is to accomplish three large items. The first goal is that the team should choose a name and identify itself to the organization. The second goal is that the team number should be in the HTML tab name as well as the footer. Lastly, the last goal is to plan and distribute work properly utilizing the proper GitHub rules. 
* For the About epic the goal is to create team preferences. We will have an image and mission statement for the team. We also need to have an image, name, and short bio for each team member. It goes to say that there should be a consistent style and formating. We also want to progressively add information to this file to reduce clutter.

## Review

#### Epics completed  
* We have completed the About Epic where we were able to create a team image and mission statement together. We also completed our Bios as well as maintained our existing styling.
* We have completed the Team Identification Epic where we had to choose a team name, update the project, and distribute work
#### Epics not completed 
* We were able to complete all planned epics during this sprint

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
* Our team was able to stay on track and complete the necessary tasks associated with the sprint. We consistently did work throughout the sprint. We held multiple meetings where we worked together to complete larger tasks. For the most part, everyone was able to follow the proper etiquette when completing tasks. When mistakes did occur people quickly announced them and took steps in fixing them. People were quick to respond on Slack when needing help or merging PRs.

#### Things that we need to improve
* Something we could work on is to be more consistent with the number of SCRUM meetings we have. Make sure all PRs are linked with a necessary task. Be extra careful in following proper GitHub etiquette.
