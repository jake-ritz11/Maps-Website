## Planned Epics

### User Experience
We will continue to improve our user experience by doing another round of asking people to play with our site.

### Save Map
The user will now be able to have the trip and the map in the same file. These will be in SVG and KML format.

### Units
This will allow the user to set different units for distances traveled. These include kilometers, nautical miles, and letting the user choose their unit name and earth radius. The setting should be remembered across sessions.

### Maps
This will give the user the ability to change the map background. These will be remembered as the selected map for future sessions.

### Shorter Trip
We are going to try and finish up the Shorter Trip epic by implementing concurrency and the Three-opt algorithm

## Review

### Epics completed  
We have completed four epics which were Units, Lines, Save Map, Map, and User Experience

### Epics not completed 
We were not able to complete three-opt for the server under the Shorter Trip Epic.

## Retrospective
We were able to do a lot of polishing on our website. We implemented many optional features that we believe improves the feel and look of the website. We also worked very well in a team this time around. Overall this was a succesful sprint.

### Things that went well
Overall we did a great job this Sprint. We were able to get a good bit of work done. Our tasks were a bit more spread out or random as we spend a good amount of time tweaking the UI. We did well in speading out tasks where not one person would complete entire epics at a time.

### Things we need to improve
We don't believe there is anything to improve.
