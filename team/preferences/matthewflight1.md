1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__

   * I am excited to work in a team setting while programming.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * If the team has different goals or expectations we may run into conflicts.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I don't anticipate conflicts unless there is a contribution gap.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * It is acceptable for different team members to get different grades in a sprint.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * More than 1 hour per day per person.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * First come first serve unless people request specific activities. If no one steps up to a task, group delegation should work.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Talk to them to see what happened. If the issue repeats, reflect the issue as necessary on team evaluation.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * It is okay to discuss opinions of quality, but not to alter other's work.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * All I care about are the results. Group members can work however they prefer.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   *  Yes, astandard meeting time would greatly benefit us.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least weekly.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * No.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Work to accomodate their perspective, but sometimes one gets outvoted on some decisions.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If the team appreciates the leadership, roll with it. If they're simply taking on more work than everyone else, discuss how we can delegate work better.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Voice my concerns on the issue with my team.
